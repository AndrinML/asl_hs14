# ASL HS14
This is the semester project of Advanced Systems Lab at ETH Zurich by Andrin Jenal.

## Summary
The project outline is to implement a simple message passing system with clients, middleware and a database. After setting up the core architecture a bottlneck analysis is performed and the systems is analyzed under queue theory analogies. To put the system under a fair amount of stress AWS machines are used to simulate multiple simultaneous clients firing requests to the middleware.

## Milestone 1 - Performance Analysis  
* System Stability
* Microbenchmarks
* 2k Factorial Design
* Scale-up of Middleware
* Limits of the System 
* Bottleneck Analysis

## Milestone 2 - Queueing Theory
* Modeling the System as Queues
* M/M/m Middleware
* M/M/m Database
* Interactive Response Time Law
